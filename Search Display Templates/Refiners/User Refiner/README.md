User refiner with profile picture
================

Out of the box you get a refiner control that only shows the user his or her full name (display name). You can make this experience better by adding the user its profile picture next to their name. That way people can refine on users they know by name or by sight.

You will find two refiner templates, they are created depending on the data values you retrieve. There are two types of user values:

- **Full name**: Elio Struyf
- **User full detail value**: elst@something.onmicrosoft.com | Elio Struyf | 693A30232E667C6D656D626572736869707C6A756C69616E69406573747275796664372E6F6E6D6963726F736F66742E636F6D i:0#.f|membership|elst@something.onmicrosoft.com
